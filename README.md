- 👋 My name is Enyo
### My Education
- 📚 I have a computer science background(*Bachelor's*), and I started my tech career in front-end development. Check it out here: **https://enyo-ojo.github.io/enyoportfolio.github.io/**
- ℹ️ After some time, I got interested in Data Science and then transitioned by first doing a master's in *Business analytics* and then a minor in *Machine learning* which i just graduated from btw 👏👏👩‍🎓
- 📈 During my program, I participated in a lot of data science projects, certifications, and hackathons to broaden my knowledge in the field

### A little about me
- 🎆 An interesting fact about me is that I am interested in fashion and run a sustainable fashion business *@fibs.madeit*, on Instagram. This was one of the reasons I opted for a degree with a mix of business and tech just to get that business knowledge. 👩‍💼
- 👩‍🎨🖼️ I consider myself a creative, which is very useful in my data science and analytics journey. In another life, I would be an artist or graphic designer. Probably still in my future
- I also enjoy reading 📚
